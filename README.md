This project is an AI-powered career guidance platform built using Next.js, Firebase, and the OpenAI API via Open Router. It helps students find the right career path, prepare for interviews, and solve coding problems, including debugging.

## Project Overview
The CareerGuide AI Bot is designed to provide students with personalized career guidance and support. With its AI-powered system, students can:

- Explore career paths and receive tailored recommendations
- Prepare for interviews with practice questions and feedback
- Solve coding problems and debug their code with the help of AI-driven insights

## Tech Stack
- Next.js: A popular React-based framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated websites and applications.
- Firebase: A comprehensive platform for building web and mobile applications.
- OpenAI API: A powerful AI model for generating human-like text and code.

## Getting Started
First, run the development server:
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

Open http://localhost:3000/ with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
